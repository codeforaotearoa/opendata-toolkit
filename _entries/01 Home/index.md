The Open Data Toolkit is designed to help governments and open data enthusiasts understand the basic concepts of Open Data, how to plan and implement an open government data programme and some tricks on how to approach a dataset.

Getting started with Open Data can be easier than many people think. If you have data in a re-usable electronic form, a publicly accessible domain to put it and an open license, then you’re on the right path.

This toolkit provides a comprehensive step by step approach to help government agencies release more open data in a simplified manner.
