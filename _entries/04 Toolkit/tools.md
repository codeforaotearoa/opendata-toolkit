Here are a number of tools that you may find useful:


* **[Koordinates]** is a New Zealand based company that sources geospatial datasets from numerous parties from Government departments to independent businesses.
* **[CKAN](http://ckan.org)** is an open source data management system aimed at governments, companies and organizations want a quick way to openly provide datasets to the public. It also comes with API support included, allowing automated upload tools to be built by more tech savvy members of your organisation.
* **[Socrata](https://socrata.com)** provides cloud-based visualization and analysis tools for opening government data. It describes itself as a turn-key solution that is built to be simple to deploy with minimal technical knowledge.
* **[Github](https://github.com)** is an online source code hosting platform that utilizes the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system.
* **[ogr2ogr](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries)** is a part of the GDAL library which can be used to translate between a number of geospatial formats, such as Esri Shapefile to GeoJSON. If you are unable to install binaries on your system, there is also an unofficial online interface called [OGRE](https://github.com/wavded/ogre). For more information and examples, [this post](http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/31-GDAL-OGR2OGR-for-Data-Loading.html) is worth checking out.
* **[Octopub](https://octopub.io/)** is a site which connects with Github and provides a simple interface for uploading CSV tabular datasets for those who aren't experienced with Git or Github.
* **[Loomio](https://loomio.org)** is a tool for fast, inclusive and effective decision making. Members vote on proposals while also being able to provide valuable feedback and constructive criticism. New Zealand's NZGOAL - Software Extension Framework was created with the help of Loomio. You can see their process [here](https://www.loomio.org/g/NohQxyr9/nzgoal-software-extension) as an example of what it might look like in your organisation.
