**What is Open Data?**

According to the Open Data Institute, “Open data is data that anyone can access, use or share. Simple as that. When big companies or governments release non-personal data, it enables small businesses, citizens and medical researchers to develop resources which make crucial improvements to their communities.”

**What is Open Government Data?**

Open government data means:

Data produced or commissioned by government or government controlled entities
Data which is open as defined in the Open Definition – that is, it can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.

**What is machine readable data?**

Data in a data format that can be automatically read and processed by a computer, such as CSV, JSON, XML, etc. Machine-readable data must be structured data.

Some human-readable formats, such as PDF, are not machine-readable as they are not structured data, i.e. the representation of the data on disk does not represent the actual relationships present in the data.
