What is International Open Data Charter?

The International Open Data Charter is a set of principles and best practices for the release of governmental open data.

The charter mandates that data released by governments comply with these [principles](http://opendatacharter.net/principles/):

- Open by Default
- Timely and Comprehensive
- Accessible and Usable
- Comparable and Interoperable
- For Improved Governance and Citizen Engagement
- For Inclusive Development and Innovation

The adherents to the International Open Data Charter, recognize that governments and other public sector organizations hold vast amounts of data that may be of interest to citizens, and that this data is an underused resource. Opening up government data can encourage the building of more interconnected societies that better meet the needs of our citizens and allow innovation, justice, transparency, and prosperity to flourish, all while ensuring civic participation in public decisions and accountability for governments.

What is the Open Government Partnership?

The [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/) is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. In the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, OGP is overseen by a Steering Committee including representatives of governments and civil society organizations.

To become a member of OGP, participating countries must endorse a high-level [Open Government Declaration](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration), deliver a country action plan developed with public consultation, and commit to independent reporting on their progress going forward.

To learn more on how to be a member, read more [here](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/how-join).

How is ODC related to OGP?

One of the agenda in the action plan for OGP is to have guidelines, for member governments, to adopt the open data charter. This is part of the [action plan](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/workplan-2015-2016) for the year 2016.
